# probability [P] array for a single throw

# P array for up to 3 throws (do store P of going to jail)

# P matrix
# redistribution of P from "chance", "community chest" and "go to jail" tiles

# diagonalization of P matrix
# self-multiplying until change is minimal (must define a threshold)
# de-diagonalization

# extra: analyze profitability taking into account cost, rent and probability
