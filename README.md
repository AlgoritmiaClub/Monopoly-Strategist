# Monopoly Markov Chain

This simple program makes use of a Markov chain to determine the overall probability of landing on any given tile of a Monopoly board.

It is also the first time I'm working on a project using Git and GitHub.

This project was inspired by Matt Parker and Dr. Hannah Fry's video [The Mathematics of Winning Monopoly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubQXz5RBBtU).

*Note: the numbers could be slightly off because I haven't had the opportunity to count how many "Chance" and "Community Chest" cards there are. I assumed there's one with each of the different texts listed in the Monopoly wiki.*
